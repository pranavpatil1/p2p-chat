### Peer-to-Peer Chat

The server handles managing lobbies and "signaling server" roles of helping coordinate peer-to-peer connections.

```
npm install
node index.js
```

The clients will send each other messages without going through the server once the connection is set up by the server.

Go to `localhost:5000` click create lobby, and the other person goes to the URL specified.
